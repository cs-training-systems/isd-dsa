# Changelog

All notable changes to the **ISD Decision Architecture** research project will be documented in this file. This project utilizes [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) to track the evolution from exploratory discovery to structured primitives.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **System Documentation:** Refactored `README.md` to establish the research framing (Computational Ontology & Decision Support).
- **Project Justification:** Defined "Learning in Public" and "Taxonomic Discovery" phases to rationalize the high-density graph-based data intake.
- **Documentation IA:** Relocated security/proprietary disclosure to the compliance section for improved readability and alignment with standard repository conventions.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Structural Taxonomy:** Established the project's primary directory architecture, including `config/`, `content/`, `data/`, `docs/`, and `theory/`.
- **Primary Artifact (Initial Discovery):** Created `root.md` and `00_index.md` as the core nodes for initial topographic mapping.
- **Reference Management:** Initialized `theory/references.bib` to house the project’s theoretical foundations and background research bibliography.
- **Data Intake:** Created initial datasets (`isd_grc.csv`, `isd-grc-fdg-data.csv`) for preliminary GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) logic mapping.
- **Environment Scaffolding:** Deployed `placeholder.txt` across latent directories to preserve the structural integrity of the decision-engine schema.

### Changed
- **Node Contents:** Updated `root.md` to reflect revised granular primitives identified during discovery.
- **Architecture Optimization:** Deprecated and removed the `notebooks/obsidian` directory to streamline the transition from spatial notes to structured documentation.
- **Licensing:** Reinitialized project `LICENSE.md` to align with open-source research disclosure requirements.

### Removed
- **Legacy Components:** Deleted redundant `README.md` and `notebooks/` sub-structures to prevent version drift during structural migration.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-01-27

### Added
- **Project Inception:** Initial repository initialization and basic license declaration.
